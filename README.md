## How to Use Font Awesome 5

Font Awesome 5 comes with a number of styles instead of a singular one as in FA4. This package includes the "solid", "regular", and "brands" styles (mix and match as you like).

To use a Font Awesome icon, simply apply this syntax:

<i class="far fa-shopping-cart fa-lg"></i>

or

<i class="far fa-shopping-cart fa-lg" />

"far" means we're using the regular styling. "fas" means "solid", "fab" is for brand styling.
